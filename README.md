# Creating a dropdown

In this we created, as normal, the index.html and main.css (html5 and css files) to run a navigation bar with a dropdown menu full of list items.

## HTML 

* ensuring correct link to stylesheet
* using cloud9 html shortcuts 
* adding a navigation
* adding a button
* adding mutiple lists in shortcut and using a link to direct them on the page

## CSS

* starting with the default style for the nav bar
* adding a button and how it will look and interact with the user (the cursor/pointer and how this changes when on the button)
* styling the drop down menu, making it there visible on the page
* using box shadow and copying code from external sources for appealing design
* implementing a dropdown menu and the dropdownlist and items, styling them and how they will look when user hovers over them
* using multiple transformations (including translating x, y and z)
